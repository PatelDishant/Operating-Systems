The biggest problem that weâ€™ve encountered is the little to none documentation on the ext2 filesystem when it comes to working directly with creating inodes and dir entries.
Finding an answer to an obscure question relies on your own intuition and simply spending a couple hours playing around with the mechanics of the filesystem by yourself.
This means that you need to spend a fair amount of time just researching which unfortunately we did not have the time for. 
Being it was just the two of us, we were unable to complete the assignment with our limited time.
